**Professor:** Dr. Eloi Puertas


**Dates:**
Monday : 17h - 19h  
Friday:  15h - 17h


**Location:** B1 classroom.

**Email:** epuertas@ub.edu

**Tutorial times:** On demand.

Lab Instructor: TBA

Teaching Assistant: TBA

## Prerequisites: 

Some programming experience in Python


##Goals of Course:
1) Learn about agile methodologies for software developing.

2) Learn about what itâ€™s like to be a data scientist.

3) Learn about infrastructures for data science.

4) Learn about ethics and data privacy.


## Course Topics:
### I. Software Engineering for Data Scientists

Software Development Methodologies 

* Agile Methodologies
	* Kanban
	* Scrum 
*  Test Driven Development
	* Unit Cases  	
*  Version Control
	* GIT 	
*  Software Deployment
	* Software as a Service 
	* Containers: Docker 	

### II. Data Science Workflow
* Preparation
	* Acquire data
	* Reformatting and cleaning data
* Analysis  (*ML*)
* Dissemination (*V&P*)

### III. Infrastructure for Data Science
*(Brief intro to Data Engineering)*

* Message Queues.
* Distributed Systems for calculus. (*BD*)
* No-SQL Databases. (*DSiM*)

### IV. Ethics and Data Privacy


## Course Structure:

The first 4 weeks I will teach the basic concepts about data science and agile methodologies to build up sufficient background and foundation. 

After that, we will go through a Data Science project, following each step of the data science workflow. The project will be the same for all the class.  The classes will be divided into two parts: (1)  Review of previous material and introduction of any new material necessary to solve the current step in the project. (2) Work in team for solving and implement a solution for the current step in the project.

Finally, the last 4 weeks we will see fundamental aspects from Ethics and Data Privacy in the data sicence context.

#In Class Project
The in class project will be a typical datascience problem with real data.  You will form teams and work together.
The project starts on the end of October and the deadline will be in December. More details to come in October. 

## A Note on Programming Languages
Most of my instruction will involve Python and Python Bindings.
